		<sub>[lease know t image is semi out of date so please only reference the image for the mic settings</sub><br>
		the bars in the upper left of the image are for your mic, <br>
		the green bar is the volume of your input,<br>
		adjusting the green bar will change the volume you need to be to retrigger the blue bar
		<br><br>
		the blue bar is the "cooldown" time it takes for your tuber to go from talking back to close mouthed.<br>
		adjusting this will hange the duration of time it takes for your icon to change back to not talking.
		<br><br>
		some other things to note:
		<ul>
			<li>the ui will go away when your mouse is no longer over the application, just like youtube!</li>
			<li>please make sure your background is set to green! (#00ff00)</li>
			<li>please make sure your window is a value of 512x512px! (you can set this manually)</li>
			<li>please make sure all your images are correct!</li>
		</ul>

		<summary>stream etiquette </summary>
		the stream is pretty lax! please just take note of the following:
		<ul>
			<li><em>DO NOT CALL PEOPLE BY THEIR IRL NAMES UNLESS GIVEN EXPLICIT PERMISSION</em></li>
			<li>eating and drinking is fine! just don't do it into the mic! (it bothers viewers)</li>
			<li>try be conscious of where you are in relation to your mic! as sitting back/leaning forward will effect how it
				sounds </li>
			<li>please make sure background sounds are kept to a minimum</li>
			<li>position the mic to the <em>side</em> of your mouth like a gamer headset mic is possible to avoid plosives!
				(harsh s sounds and popping sounds)</li>
			<li>if you need to leave early, that's fine! just please announce it so i/we know and i can account for it and
				inform the viewers!</li>
		</ul>
	</details>
	<br>
	<details>
		<summary>topics to avoid</summary>
		the stream is open to topics, just keep the following in mind:
		<ul>
			<li>the stream is inclusive<br>pretend you're talking to twitter but live instead</li>
			<li>we are not politicians<br> we can obviously talk about this stuff openly, but let's not hang on it!</li>
			<li>avoid hard or depressing topics<br>
				people are viewing for fun! let's make sure to keep the mood up! (to be clear, if something is/was bothering
				you, please bring it up after the stream [or dm if urgent]! it's not about ignoring your issues, it's simply
				that we're entertaining when live; s let's just be conscious of that!</li>
			<li>no "edgy" or "dark jokes".<br> obviously the occasional one is fine, but let's keep them rare!</li>
			<li><em>the stream will have minors (under the age of 18) viewing</em><br>
				because of this, let's try keep it pg-13!
			</li>
		</ul>
	</details>
	<br>

		<summary>things i'll need to remove you for:</summary>
