# The Best Game You've Never Played

~vulbyte 2024/03~

## intro

in the year of our lord an savior 20xx it isn't uncommon for there to be remakes. infact a not insignifigant amount of games that are released are likely some remake or iterative game.

1. the last the cod games (remake of the original mw series)
1. cs2 (basically just a csgo reskin)
1. overwatch2
1. left4dead2
1. apex legends
1. pubG
1. & tf2

are all examples of games where if you were to look back on their originals, it would be hard to call the current version and the orginal the same game.

and all of these games are garbage compared to the quality and features of this videos subject

> mini montage of Mega Man powered up

## chapter 1 | what is a Mega Man?

Also known as Rockman in japan, Megaman is a sidescroller platformer shooter which originally game out [december 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man).
the game has you play as mega, taking on each level and it's subsiquent boss.

beating the boss will grant you it's power which you can then use for either locomotion or weaponization

the original game contained 6 "boss masters" with their unique levels.

<br/>

each stage has their own unique themes, gimmics, challanges, and approach.

<br/>

the main gimmic which made Megaman originally stand out was the fact that the power you took obtained after can then be taken and used against another boss in a rock, paper, sisors, dynamite, lazergun, deathray.

### the issues with the classic

the original game is plenty fun and i don't want it to seem like i'm hating on the orignal, but it's definantly has some rough edges. it is generally prettty solid with minimal complains, but it definantly more of a technical marvel then a graphical marvel.

and this gave some rather mixed results, some stages working well but others have issues like megaman blending in and the like.

with the prelim out of the way, we can talk about the subject at hand.

## chapter 1 | Megaman powered up, the new graphics

the chibi graphics can definently be... jarring for most. however compared to the original, the new graphics are night and day. it's the jump between a crt and a modern day oled. almost everything has been converted to 3d in some ways, and the things that haven't have been tastefully stylized. And what's amazing about this is this all ran on the PSP.

Infact if you have an eye for this sort of thing then you would have noticed that there's no real time lighting. Megaman has no realtime shadows, the shadow that's underneath them is simply just a black dot that follows them around which can make some platforming a little difficult due to being able to judge certain jumps is obscured, but is overall a very tasteful change.

every block has paralaxing and perspective giving the whole world a real sense of depth dispite only being 1 block deep with the background.

and with these new graphics there's multiple changes that are wonderful to see, such as almost ever level has a sort of 3 act layout where the main stage has 2 relitively defined parts with the main separation being the backgrounds denoting generally some form of change in the area. with a third unique background being for the bossroom.

## chapter 2 | the new story

the orignal game had effectively no in game story, the bulk of it actually being in the manual over in game however due to the game being released on the snes and likely onlt had about [0.125mb of storage](https://www.gbmb.org/mbit-to-mb) excuse me for being a bit leaniant.

if you wanted any story for the game you would actually need to open the [manual](https://www.thegameisafootarcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Mega-Man-Game-Manual.pdf) for this game, and turn to page 6 or 7 and actually _read_ about the story and robot masters and story. and you bet this thing being crammed into a box that's about [5 inches Tall 7 inches Long 1 1/4 inches Wide](https://forum.digitpress.com/forum/showthread.php?147029-SNES-N64-game-box-dimensions or about 12.7cm x 17.8cm x 3.175cm for those of us with and education, you bet there wasn't much being crammed in beside the cartage.

the original manual read
: "it's MEGA MAN versus the powerful leaders and fighting forces of Monsteropolis - the strange multi-faceted land of robot-like Humanoids.
brilliant scientsts Dr. Wright conceived the construction of fully-operational human-like experimental robots to preform specific everyday duties. Dr. Wrigght, and his assistant Dr.Wily, encouraged with their very fist near-human robot - MEGA MAN - proceeded to develop six additional humanoids, all programmed to preform prescribed rituals:

(a brief discription of all the bosses)

But, with the exception of MEGA MAN, all of Wright's near-human robot experimentation went awry. Assistant Dr.Wily turned disloyal, reprogramming Dr.Wright's humanoids, now bent on destroying opposition so Dr.Wily could control the wold and its resources.
resisting re-programming MEGA MAN is chosen the defender of the universe and its inhabitants. MEGA MAN dares to single-handedly penetrate seven separate empires of Monsteropolis, eliminating the leaders and follers of these sovereignites.

Get ready for some exciting challenges!"

i love how ackward these old manuals are

infact the game includes a bunch of awesome little hand drawn images of all the enemies from the game and what they look like. combined with the the pickups. and they all look so great, i also love the dopey 1-up icon.

and i learned this after noticing it from the manuals, but apparently his name was originally "dr. wright" which was a western approximation of "dr. right". however for the rest of this review i'll be saying dr.light as he's that in effectively every other ideration

### epic transition

however, this is where powered up is infinately cooler then whatever the heck the original did (which was nothing).

the game opens with mega just moving his normal day to day before being interrupted by dr.Wily, and after so he **holy shit is he from the ring?!?!**

after he steals all of dr.light's robots mega gets some upgrades, mega goes to chase after him... i assume...

and this raises the question, did light just make these? if so did he expect mega could be able to just chase down wily? and if not did he just have these on standby? was he just planning on sending mega out at some point or be some 20xx rambo?

well, actually after reading the original manual, i believe what actually happens is that wily trying to take over the world or more likely is this country.

and this big robot boss thing being whatever took over the city where Mega resides, before they move on and take on the other main robot masters taking back essential infrastructure before dealing with Dr.Wily.

the manual for this game is rather interesting, but shares some neat facts:

- mega is apparently 4'4" (about 132cm), which means that each block you see in game is about 2ftÂ³
- given Megas weight and height, means they have almost the density of of a perfect block of [mixed potassium/calcium! at a density of 115.894](https://www.angstromsciences.com/density-elements-chart)! there's no point to this, i was just nerd sniped
- they like animals and have the hobby of soccer
- and they're apparently solar powered??? like, is that what those things on his head are supposed to be???

the new game replaces the images of the in game items from the cute hand made sketches to ingame items, which i totally get but i honestly kinda miss the original sketches but there's actally a cute little comic done in the manual!

and you know, this is something that i miss about digital only games. you used to have cute stuff like this but unless you decide to go looking for stuff like this or it's included in the game somewhere like a bonus menu, then stuff like this is missed so many things.

there's also cute chibi art of each of the bosses explaining their specialties, what they do, and a reworked description of what they do

## chapter 3 | bosses and stages

the original game had 6 "robot masters", which i'll just be calling boss's.
and something i love is regardless of how practical or impractical their designs are, they all have a clear purpose that's unique and makes sense.
i'm going to save most details as i think you should play it yourself to learn and explore, but i'll share some neet things i noticed

- Cutman
  : designed to function as a lumberjack
  a detail i love about his stage is that it starts you on an outskirt of a forrest, with you going deeper and deeper until you eventually arrive at what looks like some sorta ninja forest loging camp thing and it's honestly it's just cool in my opinon

- Gutsman
  : a bulldozing character (that explains the jaw)
  this level starts you on the outskirts of some construction site, after you move deeper it you can notice excavators appear in teh background, then eceentaully turning into some deep underground driller section where you fight gutsman

- Iceman
  : able to preform and extreme temperatures with human like performance
  you start in some arctic esc section, and has with you fighting in what i'm guessing is some arctic ocean waters, which _makes a lot of sense given icemans purpose_

- Bombman
  : a heavy duty laborer who is used for demolition projects
  you start out in some factory, which ends with you fighting in some form os a missle scilo

- Fireman
  : a smelting robot
  you open up to a scorcing factory, ending up in what i can only describe as what looks like the core smelting area.

- Elecman
  : for conducting electrical operations, and supervising nuclear power plants
  when oyu load into this stage i always saw the background as a circuit board of some sort. i'm sure this is meant to be some powerplant or something but i always seen it as some form of circuitboard and always just imagined you were shrunk down and just made teeny, and elecman is just like 3microns, although this isn't the case cause you can see they're clearly the same size as everyone at the end credits.

  OR MAYBE HE WAS MADE BIG AND BIG MEGA DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

  ### and Megaman powered up does something unthought of with modern day gaming.

  they are actually insane enough to add two new bosses!

- Timeman
  : "an experimental robot created by dr.light to enable time travel, can be used to slow down time breifly". ah yes, just play with the fabric of reality why don't you
  this level has always confused me a bit, as i feel imagine this level has you climbing some sort of clocktower, but this level always felt odd wirdly disconnected from everything else. however my take is that i think this _asthetically_ this stage is the weakest. i like the challanges but this stage just feels rather weak and the final boss stage which given Timeman's bossroom, which i'm guessing is supposed to be some sort of time machine, makes me so confused. i like the interesting things they do! (other then that last jump before the bossroom), i don't think it's bad, i just think it's the weakest stage.

  and lastly:

- Oilman
  : a maintenance robot who can make oil for any occasion
  this starts you out in a desert esc area, where you push through to what i believe is supposed to be some sorta oil refinery. one thing i love about this stage is that the oil you see on the ground can be it onfire and the oil vial, tank things can be broken which i love and honestly just want way more of! this stuff is so interesting! do it moreee!

### thoughts on the characters

i don't think the new bosses are nessisarily as strong as the originals, but i think they're great and they git in rather well. something i feel like could really help would be if these robots had a bit more variation, gutsman efectively being the only one to break the 1x2 block size, however i suppose if they're meant to be humanoids this makes sense enough. especally consdiering that roll, light, mega, wily and the like all have a similar height.

wait a minute... if megaman is 4'4", does that mean that basically everyone in this game is liek 4-5ft? _does some googling_
that's so odd, the average height in japan for males is about 5'7", and for women it's 5'2", so considering it doesn't seem like a locality thing i suppose it was just a poorly thought out choice? or maybe it was to make everyone seem more "kid like" for whatever reason?
