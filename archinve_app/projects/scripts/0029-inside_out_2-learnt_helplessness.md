# inside out 2, learnt helplessness

! hyperboly warning !

inside out 2 is a good movie with a horrible execution. <br>

## intro

I reworked htis a few times, the best way i can find to do this is by recounting the story while covering topics, to which at the end i'll group bigger issues i have together in order to sorta discuss the topics in a larger sense and my much larger issues.

now is spoiler territory so if oyu haven't watched the first or the 2nd spoilers for bother, i will ruin the story for you if you haven't watched either yet.

## concepts

Incase you missed either movie and wish to watch anyways, hey, thanks! here's what you need to know:
 
This movies concept at it's heart is "what if emotions were anthropomorphic".

so the idea is that instead of emotions being a cocktail of hormones and receptors and the like all mixing together to produce complex feelings, the idea is you have a core collection of emotions who do everything, and they're fighting for everything. and although this concept is flawed in a few ways i think for entertainment purposes it's a fine enough abstraction and is sorta nice because it can help kids conceptualize concepts like depression or anxiety without really being detailed about it.

So the idea is you can do something like say; combine fear and disgust to make terror.

With that out of the way we can slam into the story and minor critiques.

## the story and minor issues

Riley, our pseudo protagonist is playing a hockey game, to which there's then a punch in to Riley's mind, where we meet the 5 core original,

- joy
- sadness
- anger
- fear
- and disgust

Thees emotions all combine to make what was Rileys core emotions, until one day during the middle of the night the 

> i kid you not

They then show this little thing which is meant to be the essence of Riley, this sorta abstract shape thing which is meant to "make up Riley".

*puberty* alarm goes off and alerts after some buffoonery a whole bunch of emotions show up, these new ones being:

### issue 1: 

- shyness
- envy
- boredom
- anxiety (our pseudo protagonist)
- and i guess to make it a 5th; nostalgia?

> Whatever, i have more rants about them later.

These emotions interact with the old, showing they're useful until there's a disagreement, to which anxiety orders Rileys core being sent "to the back of their mind";
then the main 5 out only to be replaced by the new 5, being shoved in a jar

> obligitory jar joke

> now is when i have to confess, this is when my opinion of the movie plummets, but we'll get more into detail about this all later.

it's at this point they're put into a vault of "surpressed thoughts" and other stuff, to which we meet 3 new things:

- a cartoon character i can't remember the name of but is clearly a blue-clues, dora the explorer unholy fusion i wish would find a cliff.
- Rileys "deep dark secret" 
- and a video game character

After which they get broken out of the jar and escape due to the most contrived scene i have ever seen in my li-
> nonono, now is not the time for that

So they make it out and there's a breif 

## major issues

### soundtrack gives chicken little vibes
(motif compared to halo, call response)

### it implys all negitivity is from within (curtacy of [@bubbshalub](youtube.com/@bubbshalub)

### does anxiety not ruin the whole dynamic?

### the panic attack scene feels like it's trying to parody puss'n'boots last wish without the proper credit

### the console can call joy, but doesn't push away anxiety?

### the movie implys you are only a subject of your emotions, and if you're not motivated to do something then you just lack the emotion to be motivated

### learned helplessness, and a lack of agency
