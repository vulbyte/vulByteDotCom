	<h1>stack overflow ai</h1>
	<p>so i have been interested in llms since the first day they came out, and i was rather tired of how tedious it is to
		ask questions their and how long it takes, so i made this web portal to answer all your programming questions <em>to
			the same quality or higher</em> as what you would find on stack overflow. and made it free to use out of protest.
		<br>
		enjoy the AI
	</p>

	<div>
		<label>input:</label>
		<input id='llm_input' type='paragraph'>

		<button id='submit'>submit question</button>

		<output id='llm_output'> ask something to get a response!</output>
