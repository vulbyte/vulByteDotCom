## intro
so, i spent a year with the owel and they're... a bit temperamental...

anyways, since the beginning of last year i've spent time learning  basically everyday, and although i missed a few days i'm still above 80% of my days hit, which for me is a success.

using the app to for a year to learn specifically one language was really neat and was great because i managed to learn a good amount without needing to dedicate an excessive amount to it all.

is what i would say if i was a paid shill which i'm not.

## the good
duolingo is genuinely a good app for learning the basics. i won't dish that, and i think for a language that DOES Not use the same alphabet at your own it is probably really great!

however, for Spanish, i feel it's good for getting you upto speed.

the issue is if you're not struggling with reading, it becomes really niche really quickly.

for instance right now, i can do some pretty basic things. and i'll cut the crap and say what i feel so far.

duolingo is targeted towards, and is great for people wanting to travel. if you can do about 6 lessons a day and retain it i would argue you're good enough for a trip to a country that speaks said language. you won't be fluent, you won't even be good at it, but you'll be able to get around and say the basics.

the issue is duolingo is very built around the idea that you will be traveling and will be needing to use this as a utility. which is honestly really good i would bet. however, my issue is i don't want to learn spanish to navigate; i want to learn it to speak it and converse with people in another language, and so far i don't feel like i can do that after just shy of 300 days of learning.

at the time of writing which is december 11th, 2024, i can understand very basic things. 
i can do simple things such as ask:

who, what, when, where, why, and how, which is essential from my world view to be able to converse.

i also know how to express things like: want, need, and do you want or need.

and i can count from 0 to 9.

which is really really great!

however, from a language perspective i am no where near close.

## the bad
at the aforementioned date, i attempted to take part in my first non-structed spanish engaugement. i attempted to watch a spanish movie i haven't watched before in spanish. 
El Halcon: sed de vengaza.

at 2:55 i had to turn on the subtitles.
i was so far gone because language is far more contextual then basic who what when where why want need bluhbluhbluh.

i would love to sing high praises but it's hard for me to really understand everything properly and i sorta just can't.

## the ugly
what makes things worse overall is that duolingo has recently started to part take in dark patterns to make the free tier worse, making it so that you can no longer easily do a practice lesson to keep your streak going. hiding it away so that you think you need to watch an add or pay to be able to continue.

## conclusion
i think duolingo is an amazing suppliment or even primary learning resource, however you WILL need to do a lot more then 5minutes a day to become fluent. 
so here's my ultimate recommendation: use diolingo for the first 3 months for about 15 minutes a day or until you run out of hearts to learn the basics on the free tier. 

however, once you start getting the basics of sentence structure and the who what when where why how of it, start watching media, family friendly stuff because it often has simpler language and get a secondary learning resource to become your main way of learning, as i said use duolingo to supplement that and boost your learning.

i don't regret the time i spent with duolingo, but i don't feel like my time was spent all that well with it. i will continue to use duolingo to start learning either japanese or chinese, i haven't decided yet; maybe hindi. and i will no longer be using duolingo to learn spanish.

i think it is a much better use of "can time", where instead of doom scrolling or whatever it gives me something quick to do that's a lot more stimulating long term, but i don't think that has been good past that.

### outro
