# WRITE THIS WHOLE THING AS IF IT WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURT OF THE PUBLIC

commenting as i watch (with timestamps cause i'm fun):
disclaimer: i was actually sick at home with a really bad cold when this happened, so i was actually noticing almost all this live. the timestamps are also lazy so not 100% accurate, but they should be withing the ballpark.

[00:01:00] - "wokedot": 
it was a response to people already calling godot woke. godot just skidded into the drift and where having fun my poking fun at the people saying it.

[00:01:50] - "focus on the engine not the politics": 
the community manager doesn't possess the skills or the ability to work on the engine. this point was commonly meme'd on due to lack of understanding that to work on a game engine is one of the hardest things a coder can do in their field. it's similar to the whole idea of "9 women can make a baby in 1 month" mentality.

[00:02:50] - "i don't like to assert my opinions or politics into things":
you've said this like 3x now, i get you wanna portray that but just own it and skid into the drift at this point. like how at one point you said you hate the word "woke". i'm not putting meaning behind it because to unfortunately be the meme, that is very political lol

[00:03:00] - "the titanium backer was blocked!":
that teir is a donation cost of 100$/month. and very clearly conflicted with the community godot wants to foster. and PIRATESOFTWARE paying for "sponcer gold" is actually 300$ more in 1 year then what the "titanium" detonator was. 
as well as to those this is a thing that may be uncommon to those who are not experiance with open source, but a lot of "open source" projects that are ran off donations will commonly refuse money, and even contributions to the project if they don't like it. THEPRIMAGEN (a famous furry[jk the name is a furry species]) has gone on record many times saying "i refuse any and all code contributions because they're not what i want out of the project" (to paraphrase). we need to remember donations are not salaries nor a contract, but simply an act of charity.

[00:03:35] - "banned for just reporting on it":
godot at the time was under a lot of attention at the time this was happening, i believe seeing it peaking in the nabourhood of about 1500 tweets in 1hr. if you're getting that much flack and trying to do something about it you're without a question going to cast some strays. they've since made a forum where you can appeal the ban.

[00:05:10] -  "i captured so many hidden replys put their by the community manager talking about their disgust with the community manager!":
yeh, you also captured a lot of lgtb+ hate, unsavory comments, just pausing your scroll shows a bunch of these (many of which i think could get you a strike if the youtube bot flagged them or someone reported you as a warning). 
another thing to mention is "hidden comments" aren't exclusively done by the moderators of a page, but are also done by twitter themselfs for using things like "spicy language", or other problematic things that *twitter as a platform doesn't want spread".

bias forming
at this point it feels like @itsyaboidonnie doesn't know much about twitter, coding, or the open source culture, and even one of their own examples they use as "proof" clearly shows a lot of exceptions to that which is just sorta annoying, and makes me feel like they're a lot of uninformed yapping but i'll continue since i already typed this much.

[00:06:00] - "the creator said you shouldn't be banned!":
okay? that's one guy. godot is made up of a foundation which includes many many people who hold different decision making power and what not. it's in the same way most musicians don't own their music [thankfully that's changing] and an individual doesn't speak for a company. it doesn't matter what this one person thinks, creator or not, if the socials team/foundation think otherwise he has no say, it's how it works.

[00:06:27] - "they even hid this reply!":
google "twitter cisgender meme" to learn more, more at 7pm est

[00:07:17] - "why is it always someone who looks like this?":
ignoring the obvious horrid tones that gives off, let's continue. i get you were trying to play it as a joke, and you played both sides so it's not "muh bias" or anything but this feels just sorta a thing is poor taste to say.

[00:08:20] - "going off the rails in their own discord!":
godot acknowledged that this is an unofficial discord community server. people seem to not understand that the godot foundation is the source of truth, then everything else is unofficial and pointless. and should not be conflated as the main thing. is it a branding issue? yes. is it "all the godot foundations fault"? no, this is like learning how people on deviant art draw pokemon and getting upset at pokecorp.

[00:09:00] - "people like this are going more damage then good": 

[quick little disclaimer, i don't agree with everything the admin/mod said, and there's lots i disagree with that they said and have reportedly done. i'm not sticking up for them, just the concept of what they did]
i would argue if not for media they would me (hang with me now), with how at about 7:17 you said "they all look like this!", you ended up profiling them due to choices. in the same way they probably were in highschool for acting a bit different etc. and with something like a discord server people are going into a place that wasn't made for them or what they want to do and are like "this isn't how i expected, bad!". a lot of people in discord servers are trying to find a community and a place to fit. a lot of them are already social outcasts in some form, whither it's anything from being shy, previous mistakes, physical/mental disabilities and or illnesses, or simply darring not stand in line. and it's much harder to manage something at scale then not.

completely ignoring the fact we have 0 content what the other person said or how they said it, i also need to point out the godotengine discord has about 20k people, and an unofficial godot discord "godot cafe" has 90,000 USERS. i have personally managed a discord server that was upto 500ppl [nuked it cause it was actually too stressful lmao], and i see yours currently is ~70 (all numbers at the time of writing [duh]), and i need to point out rules and what you can and cannot express are very very very different at different scales. i once told someone "oh yeh dude, post whatever it's all good" expecting normal people stuff, and this random started posted some very not good stuff to say the least.

ik i'm hammering on this point a lot, but there's this story that's passed around about "kicking a [certain german party from wwII] out of your bar as soon as they walk in", and i think it's worth a read because when you have 20,000k people, a lot of whom probably have unsavoury views, you better let them know those views aren't welcome or you now have a server of a certain party.

[00:09:25] - "since they've become radicalized":
pretty big stretch of that word, i don't think being spicy on twitter/discord is "radicalized" but sure i guess.

[00:10:00] - gamer word:
i wanna start this by being very very clear that i don't think that word is cool or should be used
but i jsut wanna point out [edit2: this was] around the time idubbz was really popular, and 4 years ago [who is also famously known for using the gamer word they now denounce] it looks like they were still in highschool, let alone the almost 8 it is now [at the time of writing]. 
(edit3: this sentance was wack) i'm not saying what they said is good (infact i'm not), but i think is airing out what is dirty laundry from when someone was a teen just feel to be in bad taste, not very relivant, and kicking someone while they're down

EDIT: I WAS JUST LOOKING BACK AT THIS AND THEY VERY CLEARLY WERE DENOUNCING IT, LIKE THEY SAID IT WHICH IS BAD BUT THEY'RE VERY CLEARLY TRYING TO SHIT ON SOMEONE FOR SAYING IT LIKE ????


[00:10:10] - "and now you wanna talk politics?! get out of here!":
i mean, we have 0 idea about their opinions on this now. my guess is if given the change they would very likely denounce what they said and state very clearly that they don't stand for that anymore. id be willing to bet if they remembered it for whatever reason one day [because they likely forgot], for instance, you tell me what you said 2016 Oct 23rd without telling me, would oyu still stand by those opinions? would you still say you are now who you are then?

attempting to be sympathetic i would bet if they remembered they said any of that they would likely have gone back and deleted it not only out of fear of being caught, but also probably a sense of shame and a sense of "oh god i can't can't believe i was so stupid to every say a thing that stupid". but no one has bothered actually asking or has taken into consideration 8years is 8YEARS, YOU CAN GET A DOCTORATE IN THAT TIME LIKE WHAT [edit 4: messed up the time needed for the doctorate]

[00:10:18] - "keep politics out of videogames!":
sigh
no? games are art, art can be political. many games can be political has parody, as a statement, or not at all. "get down mister president", "super bernie world", basically any fps game, (even doom 2016 [not sure about the others, only played 2016] can been seen as a metaphore for invading another land for their resources just to get blown away by the civilization of said land cough vietnam war cough cough*, *cough Niagara frontier 1812 cough cough*, *cough basically the entire midevil period cough cough sorry no idea where that game from).

if you wanna make a game not political that's your choice, plenty of those games exist, but but there's plenty that do as well. but it feels very "arm chair quarter back" to tell others what to do. why should you [you being anyone who isn't the creator] get to tell someone else what to do? it's so silly and preposterous that the logical holes are just overwhelming honestly. imma try sum it the best way i can "you're not my god, my parents, or my government, nor am i on your payroll or have any contract with you, so why should i listen to you?"

[00:10:20] - "if you wanna do politics well, go metal gear solid":
due to my above comment, im going to completely ignore what you likely mean and assume you think "nano machines son" is peak political commentary because i said my 2 bits above and that is just way funnier

[00:10:36] - "stop putting political views no one cares about-":
i think if people didn't care they wouldn't be this worked out about it, i can agree that most politics people "fight" over are some abstract thing in their mind that is too far disconnected from the actual point that what they're actually fighting is completely disconnected, but i think that's reading way too much into something you probably just said over a live reaction of your twitter feed/some reddit post/forum.

[00:10:46] - "this is bs no one wants to see":
tying this into my  comment above, i want to actually point out, is if you go onto the way back machine as of 2024, sept 19th , godot had: 59483$monthy, 1491 members, and 19 corperate sponsors, and on 2024, Oct 2nd, godot had: 56797$monthy, 1561 members, and 18 corperate sponsors
which is a 4.69%(nice) increase in total memebers from before 

so although their donation $ went down, and they lost 1 corporate sponsors 
[ which i personally looked into, the people who stopped sponsoring actually seemed to be in support of the godot politic stuff, and even one of their other companies is still donating/listed as a sponsor, so i think it was just bad timing for the 1 year banner to expire. i'm not 100% certain, but that's in the same way i'm not 100% certain i'll kick the bucket sometime after my grandmother does. ]
it does actually seem like people enjoyed this message, and infact actually seem to have donated what they could to support godot the best they can despite the backlash

well that took forever, hey ughh, imma just make this a video so ughh, i guess imma just use this as draft one of the script! so ughh, hey, guess you all get to see it before i make it lolz so ughh, look forward to it i guess? lmao thanks for working as a bounce board
