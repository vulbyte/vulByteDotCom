## concept and first movie recap 

massive warning spoilers for the first two movies, as we'll be talking about the movie in length

inside out two is a follow up to disney's pixar's shockingly successful film 'inside out',
a film which stars Riley and her five emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust.


the first movie involves around the idea of Riley's emotions kinda going away for a while,
due to joy's selfishness with Riley her and sadness fall out the 'mind palace' and have to make it back.
Riley being so upset and discontent with her current state of being she makes the irrational decision to get a bus ticket back to the town she just moved away from in an attempt to find her 'joy' again.

During this joy learns that the other emotions are important and have value.

it's a wonderful movie that although has some fun ideas and explores some unique theme's and concepts. 7.4 out of 10. Swap ellen out and easy 8/10 moving on.

(if you want me to talk more in depth about inside out 1 let me know in the comments and i cannnn)not belive believe how hard they dropped the ball with inside out 2 on both a conceptual and emotional responsibility level.

### inside out 2, the problem child

The movie involves Riley going to a summer-camp while: 
puberty begins to hit her (because let's not be coy that's what's happening here), 
as well as this turning out to be the last few weeks Riley is going to be able to hang out with her best friends, 
as well as being the period of time where Riley has the ability to join a prep team.
as well as 5 new emotions this time around: anxiety, shame, envy, boredom, and one that's played for a joke: 'nostalgia'.

Clearly all being a lot for a young person to deal with, over the course of like 2 weeks.

The movie involves a lot of themes about that ackward transition phase where you go from a goofy kid who is a person, but isn't concious yet. 

> *but what do i mean by that?*

I'm glad you asked! you see,from my personal experience i have noticed that kids don't really actively 'think'. You can totally teach a kid new concepts and ideas and all those sorts of things, but I personally have noticed most kids don't really actively think until around 13, some earlier some later.

If you have any younger siblings you can totally do this as a test. As long has your sibling trusts you can totally say something like 'mom asked you to do a thing' and they'll do it as long as it's within reason. They don't *think* critically until the aforementioned 13, and they don't really have solid opinions until around 16 at the earliest. 

At which when they do, they tend to do more things 'against the grain'.

> So why would you mention all that?

Well, because that's where i feel inside out 2 messed up so horribly.

They play largely into this idea of 'your emotions are who you are and are you' angle.

This movie has I believe one scene where they play into the scene well, where they show Riley actually debating back and forth, but ultimately *she* didn't make the choice, anxiety did.

Not pay attention to how I said that as it will be a reoccurring theme.

She then has a few more moments where she has similar moments of emotions driving her actions such as when she sneaks into the coaches office to look into her book of notes, or during the climax where she's just suddenly an ass to her former teammates. 

But no, her... anxiety was making her do that...?

and before you go off, yes her sense of self was 'lost', however that doesn't discuss other emotions.

## the cons
### the other emotions?

This is where to me emotion metaphore really falls appart. Before the idea  was that you *the person* has a few simple emotions. It was abstract to the point of suspending disbelief.

However, now with emotions such as anxiety, shame, etc it brings into question so many other things. What about remorse? Isn't anxiety just far with fore-sight? Grieving? 

Actually, let's back up to that last point.

Fear during the the first movie at about (22:30)-ish is shown TO ALREADY BE DOING ANXIETY'S JOB! WHY IS ANXIETY HERE!?

### moving on

This movie completely disregards the concept of thought and the thing that makes us unique.

This whole movie takes away the idea of emotion accountability to justify the emotions in this movie with this plot. This whole movie tends to give into the idea of 'i am my emotions'.

And I think that's an absolutely terrible message to send out; ESPECIALLY considering this is going to be shown to a really young audience who will be very impressionable and will likely be a large part of their personal mental model growing up.

And I personally feel like that's absolutely terrible considering it takes away the idea of accountability.

Not just that but the idea of controlling ones emotions to allow ones self to do what is needed, expected or wanted.

> to be very clear, i'm not saying to people who are depressed 'just be happy lol' or to people who have anxiety 'just don't worry about it'. But there's also a line of 'just because you're angry at someone, doesn't mean you sit them'

This isn't me trying to nitpick, it's a genuine concern, how does Riley now *think*?

### what's going on inside your head?

But that's the thing, she apparently doesn't, which in my opinion is an insane degradation of the human experience.

Now as you may or may not be aware, I'm an artist, programmer, and designer. Both things that are very thought heavy and require you to be very very concious of what you're doing, how, why, and all that other stuff.

So the part of this movie that bothers me the most is the 'brain storm'. And the reason being that I completely understand it's the whole 'we need an idea but can't think of one', however i feel like that completely breaks the idea of the create process and basically spits in the faith of it.

I'm sure Disney doesn't have any experience with that (live actions).

See, to me the human experience is something formed primarily on the conept of 'you are your ideas, experiences, and emotions'. A much more complex process of thought.
To me the creative process is something where you take the former and mix and mash them to create something new. 
You take something, like let's say there's a bully you had at school, and they got a really big growth spurt compared to everyone else. They were say say maybe 1/2 a foot to a foot taller then everyone else. 
They're ginormous compared to you, and everyone else! They're also crude and smell bad and... wait a minute, that's sounding a lot like something like say a troll or an orc.

And that to me is such a beautiful representation of how a person can think and create! And this movie has sorta just pushed that off to something that just 'comes to you'.

### wrapping up

I'll be honest, I wanted to go on more. I wanted to talk about how joy learned nothing from the last movie, or some things i like about the movie such as the isles of memories changing and looking like a brain, or even how I think the soundtrack has some chicken little vibes. 
    But, i don't think that is good, they crumbs compared to the Mountainous issues i just talked about. As a fan of the first movie and pixar I *wanted* to enjoy this movie [not you (lightyear)], but I'm not going to pretend to like something I don't. 

I want to be more positive, like, I genuinely think this movie is gorgeous, but I just CAN'T bring myself to recommend this movie. 

I can't actively think of a replacement for this outside of the first. If you want a better representation of anxiety, watch puss in boots 2. If you want a better Example of this concept, just watch the first and leave it their.

sorry to end it on a bummer, but hey, have a good one, catch you next time.
