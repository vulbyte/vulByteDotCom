# comparing video editors:
---

but yeh, tldr on my opinions (btw i'm ignoring cost and politics):
```
avid:
fine, but it's an old piece of software largely beign neglected, it works well but it's an absolute pain to adjust anything that isn't stock with deep deep menu diving at times```
blender: 
best timeline experaince, audio  work is basically non-existant
```
davinchi:
full fledged editor, works great but is very stubborn at times, can be a uncomfortably chunky at times, especally with no gpu, powerful audio edior but commonly desyncs
```
final cut:
great editor, easily the "best feeling",
file mgmt is garbage, 
lack of basic audio effects liek sidechainging is an insane oversite (logic doesn't count)
```
imovie:
amazing first video editor,
limitations hurt production quality far too much and the artifishal limitations will mean you quickly outgrow it with anything that isn't a facebook video
```
kdenlive:
great editor at times, 
export settings feel inconsistent, confusing, and unclear,
the "plugin workflow" currently feels pretty rough and would like to see a rework,
audio engine does work, but is pretty chunky at times
```
movie maker:
the goat but discontinued, also lacks more advanced features, but is a bit less limited then imovie, at a worse ux
```
premeir:
solid, but is buggy
```
vagas:
neglected, runs fine but is buggy at times, likes to crash, almost everything works but always feels like there's just 1-2 things missing to really make it feel great
```
