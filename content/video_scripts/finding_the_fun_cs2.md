# finding the fun | CS2

## intro

cs is a game that is older then i am, it's legacy is nothing short of incredible, 

however i have never been into cs games.

(getting headshot montage etc)


after all my playing, god i don't have a lot good to say.
## CONS
### lack of ADSing (expect specific guns)
- ruins immersion
- over reliance on the cursor (crosshair)

### stagnation
- no new guns
- shotguns are ass
- new smoke are just a buff to grenades

### 2 is worse then go
- missing community servers
- massively diminished map pools
- over fracturing of ranked (rank per map is stupid, if you're a pro you should be good on every map)

### game is too reliant on ak/awp meta
- no reason to choose any other gun if you have money
- shotguns suck
- economy has very little effect outside ranked

### games are boring generic 3 lane tedium
- if not very close
- asymetrical
- always a race to the line
- no incentive to play slow unless you're trying to fake

### new flashes suck
- direction means nothing
- no counter play

### stuck movement wise
- outside boosting there's little to no freedom
- no creative positioning 


### removed macOS support
- cs:go had it so they should have it too
- product has been taken away from me after i bought it

### year later and there's basically no content outside skins
- why should i keep playing outside girrafics


### nothing but sweat
- all aim based

### cases 
- boy i sure love gambling

### guns all sounds boring and too similar
<br>

## PROS
### low demand (not on storage, is not 32GB)
- can run on a potato and look great

### very simple
- good "my first fps" against bots to learn mouse and keyboard as the controls carry outward

### low complexity
- not too much choice
- little overlap
